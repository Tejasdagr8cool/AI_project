**Blog Writer Agent:** Crafts a blog post based on the extracted content.
Features

**Automated Content Research:** Gathers detailed insights from YouTube videos.
**AI-Powered Blog Writing:** Transforms video content into engaging blog posts.
**YouTube Channel Integration:** Targets specific YouTube channels to retrieve relevant videos.
Installation


**Usage**

Use the Blog Researcher Agent to gather video content on a specific topic.
Use the Blog Writer Agent to create blog posts from the research.
